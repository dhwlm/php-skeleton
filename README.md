# php-skeleton
> A basic php project starter kit

I found myself writing the same project boilerplate time and time again, so I decided to create this simple boilerplate to help reduce the time required when starting a new piece of code. This will give you the basic files, and will let you develop small apps easily.

## Installing / Getting started

Download the boilerplate

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dhwlm/php-skeleton.git your-project-name
```

This will create a folder with 'your-project-name' and the boilerplate files inside it. Then edit the config.php file to set your own project meta information.

## Contents

```shell
|-assets
  |-css
    |-stylesheet.css
  |-images
    |-content
    |-layout
  |-js
    |-common.js
|-config
  |-config.php
  |-database.php
  |-session.php
